# Introduction to Algorithms Final Project
This repository contains my solution to the following problem:

**Problem Description:** Consider *m* machines and *n* â‰¥ *m* jobs, each of which is specified by a start time and a finish time. Each job can be assigned to any machine, but each machine can serve at most one job at any time. The objective is to schedule the largest number of given jobs to the *m* machines. Please develop a polynomial time algorithm and write a program to implement it.
